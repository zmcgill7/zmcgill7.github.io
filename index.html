        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a junior studying computer science at Purdue Fort Wayne. I'm fully commited to life long learning and
            have a
            passion to achieve my full potential. I'm a rapid learner and strive to be teachable. Outside of university,
            I
            dedicate my time to researching, taking specialized courses, working on projects and LeetCode challenges,
            and a
            bit of Netflix here and there. The styling applied to this website is fully self taught in the span of two
            weeks
            while balencing my college courses. I utilized comprehensive courses in CSS mastery from start to finish.
            The
            message I want to convey is that I am malluable to needs of a company. I love working with others and have
            developed strong soft skills to allow for easy transitions into workplace enviorments. I am eager to align
            my
            skills with the needs of your company and am committed to rapidly acquiring any additional expertise
            required.
