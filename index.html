    <h1>Hey, I'm Zack.</h1>
    <p>I'm a software developer.</p>
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a junior studying computer science at Purdue Fort Wayne. I'm fully commited to life long learning and have a
        passion to achieve my full potential. I'm a rapid learner and strive to be teachable. Outside of university, I
        dedicate my time to researching, taking specialized courses, working on projects and LeetCode challenges, and a
        bit of Netflix here and there. The styling applied to this website is fully self taught in the span of two weeks
        while balencing my college courses. I utilized comprehensive courses in CSS mastery from start to finish. The
        message I want to convey is that I am malluable to needs of a company. I love working with others and have
        developed strong soft skills to allow for easy transitions into workplace enviorments. I am eager to align my
        skills with the needs of your company and am committed to rapidly acquiring any additional expertise required.
